# Recipes Blazor App

#### This is a project I created to practice authentication/authorization, front end design, as well as consuming APIs. I used Azure AD B2C to allow users to create an account and sign in. It also allows users to edit their profile and reset their password. If a user creates an account, they can submit a recipe for review before being added to the site. Users also has the ability to favorite recipes.
