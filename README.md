# Recipes Blazor App

#### This is a project I created to practice authentication/authorization, front end design, as well as consuming APIs. I used Azure AD B2C to allow users to create an account and sign in. It also allows users to edit their profile and reset their password. If a user creates an account, they can submit a recipe for review before being added to the site. Users can also favorite recipes. 

#### I used Microsoft's documentation & code examples, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT to complete the project. The biggest challenge I faced was learning how to implement Azures auth systems.
